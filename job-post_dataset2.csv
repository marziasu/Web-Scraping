Background

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core principles at UNDP: we value diversity as an expression of the multiplicity of nations and cultures where we operate, we foster inclusion as a way of ensuring all personnel are empowered to contribute to our mission, and we ensure equity and fairness in all our actions. Taking a ‘leave no one behind’ approach to our diversity efforts means increasing representation of underserved populations. People who identify as belonging to marginalized or excluded populations are strongly encouraged to apply. Learn more about working at UNDP including our values and  inspiring stories.

UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.

Signing of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord in 1997 was a major political achievement, marking the end of a protracted low-intensity conflict in the region. One of the key government strategies outlined in the 8th Five-Year Plans is to fully implement the provisions of the Peace Accord. The government also aims at implementing accelerated development activities in the region. Despite these good intentions, the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) still suffers from its remote location, diverse ethnic composition, and limited infrastructure, impacting essential services such as education, healthcare, and water access. Despite commitments, the CHT institutions haven't achieved their full potential due mainly to undefined roles and pending elections, hindering effective service delivery and regional governance. The unique biodiversity of the CHT, including forests, wildlife habitats, and waterbodies, is at risk due to the diversion of forest land for population and settlement growth, inappropriate agricultural practices, and climate change.

To continue the momentum of successful implementation of the Promotion of Development and Confidence Building in CHT project (2003–2016) and Strengthening Inclusive Development in CHT (SID-CHT 2017-2023), MoCHTA and UNDP, with assistance from a number of Development Partners, have undertaken a new project titled “Ecosystem Restoration and Resilient Development in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (ERRD-CHT)”. The project focuses on enhancing resilient ecosystems, development and governance in the CHT by building community and ecosystem resilience through various development and conservation outputs and activities. Support for resilient livelihoods and micro-enterprises will be combined while conserving ecosystems and biodiversity and improving local governance by empowering local communities, including women and youth and marginalized sections, and institutions in partnerships with the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), counterparts, traditional leaders, and development partners.

The ERRD-CHT Project Will Produce Results On Four Interlinked Levels, Thereby Strengthening The Ability Of The Population To Enhance Resilience, Development And Governance That Impact The People’s Lives And Livelihoods. The Main Objective Of ERRD-CHT Project Is “to Strengthen Gender-responsive Resilience And Development Through Improved Governance And Ecosystems, And Adaptive Livelihoods With Market Access.” Which Will Be Achieved Through The Following Four Outputs

Output 1: Improved and resilient forest ecosystems and livelihoods.

Output 2: Enhanced capacity and institutional building of the CHT institutions and strengthened democratic governance with increased people’s participation, responsive communities and more effective service delivery.

Output 3: Inclusive and gender-responsive learning and empowerment among women and girls.

Output 4: Enabled environment for self-reliant youth development and leadership.

The project will be implemented in all 121 Unions of 26 Upazilas in the three Hill Districts of Rangamati, Khagrachari and Bandarban. In the CHT, nearly 100,000 rural- and urban households will directly benefit from the project. It will include the extreme urban and rural poor and vulnerable groups, including women and youth.

Chittagong Hill Tracts Watershed Co-Management Activity II (CHTWCA II), funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), is part of Ecosystems Restoration and Resilient Development in Chittagong Hill Tracts (ERRD-CHT) - a project of the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs (MOCHTA). Chittagong Hill Tracts Watershed Co-Management Activity II (CHTWCA II), within ERRD-CHT project, is being implemented with the goal: Strengthened gender-responsive local resilience through an integrated ecosystem management approach of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. CHTWCA II Outcome is to strengthen local resilience through an integrated ecosystem management approach that improves wildlife conservation and the governance of natural resources in the CHT.

ERRD-CHT is looking for a Geographic Information System (GIS) Analyst to plan, implement, and coordinate the project’s GIS-related efforts and planning and field implementation for forest watersheds.

Job Summary

CARE is one of the world's leading international humanitarian and development organizations, committed to helping people in poor communities improve their lives and alleviate poverty. Founded in 1945, CARE is working over 100 countries to fight global poverty and marginalization. CARE has been active in Bangladesh since 1949 and is one of the largest programs in CARE confederation. Women and girls are at the core of all CARE programs because they represent half of the marginalized group and it is not possible to overcome poverty until all people have equal rights and opportunities. CARE Bangladesh works to implement programs with long-term impacts that result in sustainable changes for the extreme poor and marginalized communities.

Bangladesh has made impressive strides in its social and economic development, achieving lower middle-income status in 2015 through stable macroeconomic conditions and substantial poverty reduction. The nation adeptly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining positive real GDP growth through prudent macroeconomic policies and effective stimulus measures. However, challenges persist, particularly for its youth population. With an overall unemployment rate of 8.9% among those aged 15-29, around 27% of this group is labeled as NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). Notably, this NEET issue is predominantly a gender concern as approximately 90% of NEET youth are female. Social norms emphasizing women's household roles and movement restrictions contribute to these disparities which is evident in the significantly lower female labor force participation.

The EARN Project in Bangladesh aims at economic engagement of the NEET youth, especially women, in rural and semi-urban areas of the country. The project offers education and skills development with a focus on women-centric facilities, employment and enterprise development support, enhanced employability through creating employer linkages and upskilling of Socio-Emotional Behavior (SEB) and Entrepreneur Development (ED) skill, incubation support for employment and entrepreneurship. In order to ensure participation of women and other underserved segment, the project will promote an enabling environment, especially for the women, through targeted awareness raising and communication programs, family-based planning, counseling and involving the communities and families in planning and monitoring of implementation.

In the case of Bangladesh, a country particularly vulnerable to climate change, there are several potential benefits, and specific conditions, including youth-centric ones, that can enhance climate co-benefit advantages. The project is designed for addressing climate change impacts and disasters. Bangladesh, in general, is increasingly being exposed to climate change-related hazards. The location of the project would be spread over many sub-districts, including extreme precipitation and flooding. Education and training programs have been severely affected by flooding in particular. The potential risks to education/climate resilient training facilities covered by the project due to flooding would be significantly reduced by the design of these facilities and the inclusion of soft components (e.g., training and awareness programs), which take flood risk into account.

The project will undertake climate resilience programs and enhance institutional capacity to improve the understanding of the responsiveness to disruptions from climate change and geophysical hazards. All skills development training will incorporate climate sensitization courses that will include adaptation and mitigation measures. The proposed competitive innovation funds will also be used to customize the new climate responsive awareness among the beneficiaries.

The Management Information System Expert has a key role in projects, overseeing systematic information and data management systems for projects, programs, and organizational performance.

For every child, a champion.

The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. Nearly one million Rohingya refugees, with over 50 percent being children, reside in camps in the Cox’s Bazar District of Bangladesh and on Bashan Char Island. This population relies heavily on assistance provided by the humanitarian community whose work is aligned with the priorities of the Joint Response Plan (JRP). In response to the educational needs of Rohingya children, UNICEF and the Education Sector developed the 'Learning Competency Framework and Approach' (LCFA) during the initial years of the crisis. The Rohingya community expressed a strong desire for their children to access a formal education curriculum, which would provide a twofold outcome of providing a formal curriculum and facilitating seamless integration upon repatriation to Myanmar. The Myanmar Curriculum (MC) was piloted for Grades 6 to 9 in December 2021. Following the pilot's success, all enrolled children transitioned from the LCFA to the MC. By the end of July 2024, across the Education Sector, there were 244,836 learners (117,234 girls, 127,602 boys) in formal education following the Myanmar Curriculum. An additional 17,047 children in the non-formal ALP programme based on the Myanmar Curriculum. UNICEF is the leading agency in the education sector response supporting 10 implementing partners who provide education in 31 camps in Cox’s Bazar and in 19 schools in Bhasan Char. UNICEF’s direct programming contributes to more than 85 percent of the overall Education Sector achievement for the Myanmar Curriculum.

For the implementation of a formal curriculum, having sufficient numbers of trained teachers and improving teaching and assessment skills requires institutional systems, strong in-service teacher professional development programmes and the use of technology solutions for Education to contribute to overcoming some of the challenges. The UNICEF Cox’s Bazar Field Office is strengthening Education programme activities in the Rohingya camps with the use of technology solutions to support learners, teachers, trainers, and implementing partners with meeting the standards of a formal curriculum. The Education section is specifically focused on developing teacher training programs and implementing technology solutions to contribute towards quality and resilient education delivery. The teacher training programmes are being developed in partnership with technical institutes in Bangladesh. The programmes will support teachers in grades 3 and above to develop their pedagogical skills and subject knowledge for the Myanmar Curriculum and for kindergarten to grade 2 teachers on foundational numeracy and literacy skills.

UNICEF is working on strategic and immediate areas for the use of technology solutions:

To improve instruction by providing multimedia teaching and learning materials.
To provide compelling teacher professional development facilitated through Learning Passport for blended teacher training.
To conduct learning assessment for supporting teaching at the right level with the use of assessment platforms aligned with Myanmar Curriculum assessment framework.
To provide a learning record per child which includes assessment data and attendance data.
To strengthen adolescent skills development and inclusive education.

How can you make a difference?

Under the guidance and general supervision of the Education Manager (P4) who leads the Education programme in Cox’s Bazar, the Specialist supports the development of teacher training programmes and the integration of technology into the Education Programme. This includes in teaching practice to connect pedagogy and technology use to improve teaching, as well as to facilitate and improve teacher professional development activities and in classroom administration. Other areas of EdTech use with the Rohingya population include with parents, caregivers and community members to increase participation and involvement in education; with school administration to support record keeping and the collection, analysis and use of data for decision making; for digitalised personal learning and to support adolescent girls’ education. This recognises digital literacy as a 21st century skill for adolescents to thrive in a transforming world marked by technology, migration, climate change, and conflict. Digital literacy encompasses a set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that empower children in an increasingly digital world.

The Specialist is responsible for the planning, development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of EdTech initiatives and the establishment and implementation of two teacher training programmes within the Rohingya education response. The Specialist provides technical guidance and operation support, within UNICEF Cox’s Bazar Field Office, to ten Implementing Partners (IPs) as well as three technical partners. The Education Specialist will also be responsible for the development of two teacher training programs by providing technical guidance, providing quality assurance of the programmes, and ensuring operational feasibility of the programmes in the camps. The Specialist contributes to achievement of results according to plans, allocation, results-based management approaches and methodology (RBM), as well as UNICEF’s Strategic Plans, standards of performance, and accountability framework. The Specialist will line manage three positions (Gender Officer, Adolescent Skills Officer and a United Nations Volunteer (UNV) for Field Monitoring and Edtech).

 General Background

 

As of September 2024, Bangladesh hosts 1 million Rohingya refugees, 52% of whom are female, and 52% of whom are under the age of 18. Most refugees live in 33 extremely congested camps in Ukhiya and Teknaf sub-districts of Cox’s Bazar, and 35,510 reside on Bhasan Char, an island in the Bay of Bengal, 60 km from the Bangladesh mainland. August 2024 marked seven years since the Rohingya crisis when more than 700,000 Rohingya women, men, and children fled Myanmar to Bangladesh, joining hundreds of thousands who sought and found refuge in the country in previous years. Yet, comprehensive solutions for Rohingya refugees remain elusive. While voluntary repatriation constitutes the main durable solution, a return in significant numbers in the immediate future is highly unlikely due to the ongoing developments following the military coup in Myanmar in February 2021 and the resurgence end 2023, of active armed conflict in Rakhine State where the million Rohingya refugees come from. Conditions in Myanmar are not presently considered conducive for the safe, voluntary, sustainable, and dignified return of Rohingya refugees.

With the escalation of the conflict in Northern Rakhine State since November 2023, the operation in Bangladesh has experienced the spill overs in the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. On the one hand, UNHCR and partners have been recording a significant increase in security incidents in the camps, including homicides and abductions. UNHCR has also seen an emerging trend of organized groups recruiting refugees to engage them in the armed conflict in Myanmar. The compromised civilian and humanitarian character of asylum in the camps has heightened risks for refugees, refugee volunteers (the backbone of the humanitarian response) and humanitarian workers. On the other hand, the operation has been recording new arrivals in the camps despite the Government’s closed-door policy at the border with Myanmar. New arrivals are extremely vulnerable, many have suffered injuries as they were fleeing; there are an estimated 30,000 or more new arrivals. The government has just authorized their assistance but without registration.

In response to the Rohingya refugee influx in 2017, the Common Feedback Mechanism (CFM) was established in Cox’s Bazar. To centralize information from the various channels (Helpline, Suggestions/Complaints boxes, dedicated email addresses, Complaints Feedback and Mechanism (CFM) desks), track UNHCR’s response to refugees, enhance information management and ultimately accountability to affected populations, the Centralized Automated Information Processing Platform (CAIPP) has been developed to facilitate this process. The pilot was launched in December 2023 in 5 camps, and CAIPP was rolled out in all 33 camps in June 2024. RAIS, the UNHCR corporate tool to manage tickets with its interface with proGres, is now being incorporated into CAIPP. The next phase will entail working on the inter-operability with other CFM systems in the Rohingya Refugee Response, notably IOM’s system as co-lead of the Joint Response Plan but also WFP, UNICEF and others.

Job Summary

CARE is one of the world's leading international humanitarian and development organizations, committed to helping people in poor communities improve their lives and alleviate poverty. Founded in 1945, CARE is working over 100 countries to fight global poverty and marginalization. CARE has been active in Bangladesh since 1949 and is one of the largest programs in CARE confederation. Women and girls are at the core of all CARE programs because they represent half of the marginalized group and it is not possible to overcome poverty until all people have equal rights and opportunities. CARE Bangladesh works to implement programs with long-term impacts that result in sustainable changes for the extreme poor and marginalized communities.

Bangladesh has made impressive strides in its social and economic development, achieving lower middle-income status in 2015 through stable macroeconomic conditions and substantial poverty reduction. The nation adeptly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining positive real GDP growth through prudent macroeconomic policies and effective stimulus measures. However, challenges persist, particularly for its youth population. With an overall unemployment rate of 8.9% among those aged 15-29, around 27% of this group is labeled as NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). Notably, this NEET issue is predominantly a gender concern as approximately 90% of NEET youth are female. Social norms emphasizing women's household roles and movement restrictions contribute to these disparities which is evident in the significantly lower female labor force participation.

The EARN Project in Bangladesh aims at economic engagement of the NEET youth, especially women, in rural and semi-urban areas of the country. The project offers education and skills development with a focus on women-centric facilities, employment and enterprise development support, enhanced employability through creating employer linkages and upskilling of Socio-Emotional Behavior (SEB) and Entrepreneur Development (ED) skill, incubation support for employment and entrepreneurship. In order to ensure participation of women and other underserved segment, the project will promote an enabling environment, especially for the women, through targeted awareness raising and communication programs, family-based planning, counseling and involving the communities and families in planning and monitoring of implementation.

In the case of Bangladesh, a country particularly vulnerable to climate change, there are several potential benefits, and specific conditions, including youth-centric ones, that can enhance climate co-benefit advantages. The project is designed for addressing climate change impacts and disasters. Bangladesh, in general, is increasingly being exposed to climate change-related hazards. The location of the project would be spread over many sub-districts, including extreme precipitation and flooding. Education and training programs have been severely affected by flooding in particular. The potential risks to education/climate resilient training facilities covered by the project due to flooding would be significantly reduced by the design of these facilities and the inclusion of soft components (e.g., training and awareness programs), which take flood risk into account.

The project will undertake climate resilience programs and enhance institutional capacity to improve the understanding of the responsiveness to disruptions from climate change and geophysical hazards. All skills development training will incorporate climate sensitization courses that will include adaptation and mitigation measures. The proposed competitive innovation funds will also be used to customize the new climate responsive awareness among the beneficiaries.

The Management Information System Expert has a key role in projects, overseeing systematic information and data management systems for projects, programs, and organizational performance.

Full Stack Engineer [B2B] [SaaS],APAC,Remote,Full-time,null,"👋 Thanks for stopping by and learning more about this role at Sitemate! ✨🏗️
We’d love to hear from you 👩‍💻👩🏽‍💻🧑🏿‍💻👨🏻‍💻

Brief overview of this role:

We are looking for a full stack software engineer to join our engineering team.

This role would be great for you if you are looking for more technical authority and autonomy with your work. Maybe you’ve worked in startups, or had your own startup that has finished up, and you want to join a team that moves very quickly and places a huge emphasis on product and engineering. Maybe you don’t have quite as many years of experience as others, but think you would do well at taking on more responsibility. Your level of experience matters less than your enthusiasm to take on more responsibility and make a significant impact.

You will have the opportunity to be a part of a small internal team working on greenfield projects and experimentation. You will have direct engagement, collaboration and communication with our VP of Product Strategy, CTO and CEO.

Employment:
Full-time
Based: Sydney, Australia / Melbourne, Australia / Remote (UTC-3 to PST-8 due to overlap requirements with the current team)
Remuneration (Including Super): AUD $75,000 - 180,000 pending your level of experience
With Sitemate's diverse blend of remote and city-based team members, we ensure fair compensation regardless of your location. Our approach is informed by data sourced from Numbeo, the world’s largest cost-of-living database, which helps us maintain consistent remuneration standards across various regions.
Through our Cost of Living Multiplier, based on Numbeo's findings, we provide guidelines for adjusting salaries to reflect the cost of living in different cities. This ensures that all team members enjoy comparable living standards, no matter where they are based.

What is the working environment like at Sitemate?
We are very transparent - monthly Allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this Allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.
We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.
We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.
You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.
You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand or block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.
We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!

What does Sitemate do, exactly?
Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.
Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour as Generation Z start to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.

What will I be doing day to day in this role?
You will work as a Full Stack Engineer in one of our product teams. This entails developing features to address pain points for our customers and our go-to-market teams. Our current engineering and product processes enable us to ship multiple features each week.
For the first couple of months, you will pick up some ‘warm up’ tasks to help you familiarise yourself with our systems and processes, as well as our existing functionality. You will also be getting involved in the planning and development of new features, including by joining research calls with project leadership.
Once you have gained familiarity with our products, you'll play a key role in developing new features, fixing bugs and re-architecting core component functions.
You’ll be working closely with our delivery team (Product Owner & QA Engineers), Product team and broader Engineering team on both delivering on projects and contributing to decision making around company-wide engineering issues.
You will assist our delivery team with diagnosing any production issues by investigating bugsnag and datadog logs, and then creating hotfix releases accordingly.

What will be the biggest challenges for me in this role?
Early stage projects - so there will be unknown unknowns
Pace - we move very quickly, so you’ll need to be excited to come in and learn extremely fast
We have a strong culture based on core values and standard operating procedures, you may need to unlearn a few things from previous experience

What kind of skills and experience do I need to have? (ideally most but not all)
Javascript/Typescript experience, including Node and Angular, is preferred.
Love for all things Frontend including CSS.

 General Background

 

As of September 2024, Bangladesh hosts 1 million Rohingya refugees, 52% of whom are female, and 52% of whom are under the age of 18. Most refugees live in 33 extremely congested camps in Ukhiya and Teknaf sub-districts of Cox’s Bazar, and 35,510 reside on Bhasan Char, an island in the Bay of Bengal, 60 km from the Bangladesh mainland. August 2024 marked seven years since the Rohingya crisis when more than 700,000 Rohingya women, men, and children fled Myanmar to Bangladesh, joining hundreds of thousands who sought and found refuge in the country in previous years. Yet, comprehensive solutions for Rohingya refugees remain elusive. While voluntary repatriation constitutes the main durable solution, a return in significant numbers in the immediate future is highly unlikely due to the ongoing developments following the military coup in Myanmar in February 2021 and the resurgence end 2023, of active armed conflict in Rakhine State where the million Rohingya refugees come from. Conditions in Myanmar are not presently considered conducive for the safe, voluntary, sustainable, and dignified return of Rohingya refugees.

With the escalation of the conflict in Northern Rakhine State since November 2023, the operation in Bangladesh has experienced the spill overs in the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. On the one hand, UNHCR and partners have been recording a significant increase in security incidents in the camps, including homicides and abductions. UNHCR has also seen an emerging trend of organized groups recruiting refugees to engage them in the armed conflict in Myanmar. The compromised civilian and humanitarian character of asylum in the camps has heightened risks for refugees, refugee volunteers (the backbone of the humanitarian response) and humanitarian workers. On the other hand, the operation has been recording new arrivals in the camps despite the Government’s closed-door policy at the border with Myanmar. New arrivals are extremely vulnerable, many have suffered injuries as they were fleeing; there are an estimated 30,000 or more new arrivals. The government has just authorized their assistance but without registration.

In response to the Rohingya refugee influx in 2017, the Common Feedback Mechanism (CFM) was established in Cox’s Bazar. To centralize information from the various channels (Helpline, Suggestions/Complaints boxes, dedicated email addresses, Complaints Feedback and Mechanism (CFM) desks), track UNHCR’s response to refugees, enhance information management and ultimately accountability to affected populations, the Centralized Automated Information Processing Platform (CAIPP) has been developed to facilitate this process. The pilot was launched in December 2023 in 5 camps, and CAIPP was rolled out in all 33 camps in June 2024. RAIS, the UNHCR corporate tool to manage tickets with its interface with proGres, is now being incorporated into CAIPP. The next phase will entail working on the inter-operability with other CFM systems in the Rohingya Refugee Response, notably IOM’s system as co-lead of the Joint Response Plan but also WFP, UNICEF and others. UNHCR is an active member of the AAP Technical Working Group hosted by the Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) and feeds into the discussions that will aim at enhanced collective accountability at the level of the whole response.

Senior Full Stack Engineer [B2B] [SaaS],APAC,Remote,Full-time,null,"👋 Thanks for stopping by and learning more about this role at Sitemate! ✨🏗️
We’d love to hear from you 👩‍💻👩🏽‍💻🧑🏿‍💻👨🏻‍💻

Brief overview of this role:

We are looking for a full stack software engineer to join our engineering team.

This role would be great for you if you are looking for more technical authority and autonomy with your work. Maybe you’ve worked in startups, or had your own startup that has finished up, and you want to join a team that moves very quickly and places a huge emphasis on product and engineering. Maybe you don’t have quite as many years of experience as others, but think you would do well at taking on more responsibility. Your level of experience matters less than your enthusiasm to take on more responsibility and make a significant impact.

You will have the opportunity to be a part of a small internal team working on greenfield projects and experimentation. You will have direct engagement, collaboration and communication with our VP of Product Strategy, CTO and CEO.

Employment:
Full-time
Based: Sydney, Australia / Melbourne, Australia / Remote (UTC-3 to PST-8 due to overlap requirements with the current team)
Remuneration (Including Super): AUD $140,000 - 180,000 pending your level of experience
With Sitemate's diverse blend of remote and city-based team members, we ensure fair compensation regardless of your location. Our approach is informed by data sourced from Numbeo, the world’s largest cost-of-living database, which helps us maintain consistent remuneration standards across various regions.
Through our Cost of Living Multiplier, based on Numbeo's findings, we provide guidelines for adjusting salaries to reflect the cost of living in different cities. This ensures that all team members enjoy comparable living standards, no matter where they are based.

Why should I consider joining Sitemate?
Check out Sitemate’s team at the 2022 Offsite: Sitemate Offsite 2022
And recently at our 2023 Offsite: https://youtu.be/_aNwLDdrGWs
You can see what people really think about working at Sitemate here: Working at Sitemate
Listen to CEO Hartley Pike speak about the company’s founding and broader Go To Market strategy: Unleashing your Zilla with Hartley Pike, co-founder of Sitemate
Listen to CTO Tim Bray speak about building high quality features that solve customer problems at Sitemate: Building High Quality Features That Solve Customer Problems at SiteMate
We have equal opportunity for applicants of all genders, ethnicity and sexualities - Sitemate's team is proudly diverse. 55% of our team identify as coming from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. 43% identify as female. Our team ranges in age from 22 to 51 years old.
You will have flexible working options - our team is a blend of fully remote and hub offices. People based in hub cities typically work in the office 2-3 days per week. Our remote team members are currently based in over 10 countries including Brazil, the Philippines, Kenya, Kazakstan, Indonesia, Venezuela, & Uruguay.
You will be remunerated based on your performance. If you are performing well, you won’t need to wait 3 years or have to find better offers elsewhere to receive an increase to your remuneration. 7 out of the last 10 remuneration increases for Sitemate team members have been made pro-actively by management, without the individual needing to even raise the topic of remuneration.
You will get a laptop and a budget to set up your home office (standing desk, monitor, headphones etc).
You will have visibility into the standardised career development plan for your role, and access to a professional learning and development budget.
You will get equity options and ownership in Sitemate on a standard vesting schedule. See here a general overview of how this works:https://legalvision.com.au/5-essential-elements-employee-share-scheme/
Sitemate has grown from 5 people in 2018 to now over 100, and we’re moving into the next stage of growth! We have a product that customers are strongly engaged with, and every month we get around >400 new leads whilst spending $0 on marketing and 0 cold calling.
Sitemate’s founders have diverse backgrounds - one coming from engineering on major infrastructure projects; the second coming from product and graphic design. This brings a unique perspective internally where we blend deep industry experience with a passion (obsession) for modern best practices in product design.
Sitemate graduated from Australia’s #1 Technology Company Accelerator - Startmate
Sitemate has strong financial backing from Blackbird (Australia and NZ’s #1 Vc), Shearwater Growth Capital & Marbruck Investments.
See info on our latest raise here: Hartley Pike 👷 on LinkedIn: Sitemate raises $7.5M Pre-Series A, approaches escape velocity | 58 comments

What is the working environment like at Sitemate?
We are very transparent - monthly Allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this Allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.
We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.
We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.
You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.
You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand or block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.
We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!

What does Sitemate do, exactly?
Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.
Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour as Generation Z start to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.
Our first product - Dashpivot, is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their processes in a new digital format. This new digital format enables them to complete and track work in the field on a mobile or tablet, and automate repetitive tasks and tracking through automated workflows and real-time analytics.
See some of our user reviews for Dashpivot here:
G2 Crowd: https://www.g2.com/products/dashpivot/reviews
Trust Radius: Dashpivot - By Sitemate Reviews & Ratings 2024

What will I be doing day to day in this role?
You will work as a Full Stack Engineer in one of our product teams. This entails developing features to address pain points for our customers and our go-to-market teams. Our current engineering and product processes enable us to ship multiple features each week.
For the first couple of months, you will pick up some ‘warm up’ tasks to help you familiarise yourself with our systems and processes, as well as our existing functionality. You will also be getting involved in the planning and development of new features, including by joining research calls with project leadership.
Once you have gained familiarity with our products, you'll play a key role in developing new features, fixing bugs and re-architecting core component functions.
You’ll be working closely with our delivery team (Product Owner & QA Engineers), Product team and broader Engineering team on both delivering on projects and contributing to decision making around company-wide engineering issues.
You will assist our delivery team with diagnosing any production issues by investigating bugsnag and datadog logs, and then creating hotfix releases accordingly.

What will be the biggest challenges for me in this role?
Early stage projects - so there will be unknown unknowns
Pace - we move very quickly, so you’ll need to be excited to come in and learn extremely fast
We have a strong culture based on core values and standard operating procedures, you may need to unlearn a few things from previous experience

What kind of skills and experience do I need to have? (ideally most but not all)
Javascript/Typescript experience, including Node and Angular, is preferred.
Love for all things Frontend including CSS.
MongoDB experience is a bonus.
Experience with building no/low code automation product(s) is a bonus.
Broader non-technical understanding of the open API ecosystem, best practices and trends
