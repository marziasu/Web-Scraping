Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

Your Role in the Revolution:

In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What You Will Be Doing

Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What You Won’t Be Doing

Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Full Stack Engineer Key Responsibilities

Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Basic Requirements

At least 3 years of experience in full-stack development, with proficiency in front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or Svelte, and back-end technologies like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Flask, or Spring Boot.

Proven ability to independently manage and execute technical projects from start to finish, including gathering requirements, development, deployment, and iteration.

Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to over 8,300 employees and generated over $1 trillion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.

This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.

About You

Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.

Before you apply, consider if you can:

Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
Bring critical thought and opinion
Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
Work digital-first for your daily work


About The Role

Shopify empowers millions of merchants worldwide, simplifying complexities inherent in enterprise commerce. We cater to high growth, high volume merchants, providing the scalability, reliability, and flexibility they need to excel.

This will encompass a range of engagements such as onboarding, certification, ongoing training, and consulting. Your key responsibility will be to break down technical barriers, enabling our Partners to deliver more effective services specifically tailored for high growth, high volume merchants. This directly contributes to accelerating revenue growth. By fostering close relationships with our Partners, you'll facilitate the seamless transition of top-tier merchants to Shopify, ensuring their needs are met, and their businesses continue to thrive.

You will have the opportunity to engage directly with our Partners, particularly their technical and sales teams. These interactions will involve high-level, solutions-focused discussions about the Shopify platform, their technology stack, and their merchants' overarching goals.

We would prefer a candidate to be based in Australia and this is a remote position, regionally-focused on ANZ, requiring occasional travel for on-site partner visits.

Requirements For The Role

Experience in enterprise ecommerce, digital agencies, solutions engineering, or customer onboarding roles, with the versatility to support a broad range of industries and business types.
Mastery of Shopify’s capabilities, application ecosystem, and integrations.
The ability to educate and align partners on Shopify’s commerce vision, roadmap, and strategies.
Exceptional interpersonal and communication skills to facilitate and manage interactions with diverse groups, both technical and non-technical.

Familiarity with development lifecycles, version control systems, and development environments
A solutions mindset, enabling our largest and advanced Partners to push the boundaries of commerce with custom-built solutions.
A commercial mindset to understand the broader business and commercial implications beyond pure technical implementation.
A passion for training and enabling others to excel.
Strong time management and prioritisation skills to handle multiple concurrent requests and the ability to re-prioritise on an ongoing basis.
Adaptability to thrive on change, perform effectively as part of a team and as an individual contributor, and work across local, regional, and global dimensions in a rapidly evolving, matrixed organisation.


Responsibilities

Understanding and articulating Shopify's competitive strengths to our partners.

Collaborating with internal Shopify teams to enhance partner and merchant experiences, and to foster internal technical knowledge.
Supporting partnership teams in validating the technical claims of a partner’s value proposition and identifying the relevant audience for that partner.

This role would be great for you if you are looking for more technical authority and autonomy with your work. Maybe you’ve worked in startups or had your startup that has finished up, and you want to join a team that moves very quickly and places a huge emphasis on product and engineering. Maybe you don’t have quite as many years of experience as others, but think you would do well at taking on more responsibility. Your level of experience matters less than your enthusiasm to take on more responsibility and make a significant impact.
You will have the opportunity to be a part of a small internal team working on greenfield projects and experimentation. You will have direct engagement, collaboration and communication with our Head of Product, CTO and CEO.

Employment:
Full-time

What is the working environment like at Sitemate?
We are very transparent - monthly Allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this Allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.
We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.
We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.
You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.
You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand or block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.
We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!

What does Sitemate do, exactly?
Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.
Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour as Generation Z start to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.
Our first product - Dashpivot, is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their processes in a new digital format. This new digital format enables them to complete and track work in the field on a mobile or tablet, and automate repetitive tasks and tracking through automated workflows and real-time analytics.

What will I be doing day to day in this role?
You will work as a Full Stack Engineer in a new areas of Sitemate’s product suite that leverage AI, so you will get exposure to work with multiple products in our suite including our main product Dashpivot. This will entail developing and delivering features to address pain points for our customers and our go-to-market teams. Our current engineering and product processes enable us to ship multiple features each week.
For the first couple of months, you will pick up some ‘warm up’ tasks to help you familiarise yourself with our systems and processes, as well as our existing functionality. You will also be getting involved in the planning and development of new features, including by joining research calls with project leadership.
Once you have gained familiarity with our products, you'll play a key role in developing new features, fixing bugs and re-architecting core component functions.
You’ll be working closely with our delivery team (Product Owner & QA Engineers), Product team and broader Engineering team on both delivering on projects and contributing to decision making around company-wide engineering issues.
You will assist our delivery team with diagnosing any production issues by investigating bugsnag and datadog logs, and then creating hotfix releases accordingly.

What will be the biggest challenges for me in this role?
Early stage projects - so there will be unknown unknowns
Pace - we move very quickly, so you’ll need to be excited to come in and learn extremely fast
We have a strong culture based on core values and standard operating procedures, you may need to unlearn a few things from previous experience

What kind of skills and experience do I need to have? (ideally most but not all)

Mantle is a fast-growing, DAO-led ecosystem whose goal is the mass adoption of decentralized and token-governed technologies.

Mantle’s first core product is Mantle Network, an L2 technology stack for scaling Ethereum. Mantle Network strives to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Mantle Network’s modular architecture separates transaction execution, data availability, and transaction finality into modules — which can be individually upgraded and adopt the latest innovations. Mantle Network is the first L2 to partner with ETH restaking protocol EigenLayer for the data availability module. By adopting a rollup architecture, Mantle Network is secured by Ethereum. As the world’s first DAO-spawned L2, Mantle Network is pioneering a vision for the mass adoption of token-governed technologies.

"Programme Analyst, Gender-Responsive Governance, Dhaka (Only Bangladeshi Nationals are eligible to apply) - Dhaka","Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh",On-site,Full-time,Mid-Senior level,"Background

UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security.

UN Women in Bangladesh supports the government to implement commitments to international normative standards on gender equality and women’s human rights. The UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2022-2026, launched in 2021, and the corresponding UN Women Bangladesh Strategic Note (SN) 2022-2026, defines UN Women’s strategic engagement in Bangladesh. The country strategy focuses on strengthening the national structures and mechanisms for gender mainstreaming in policies, plans, and budgets; supporting efforts to prevent and eliminate violence against women; promoting women’s access to decent and safe work; promoting policies and government investment in women’s empowerment and resilience building in the context of climate change, humanitarian crisis as well as other threats to peace and security. UN Women works with a range of stakeholders in Bangladesh, including the government, civil society, women’s organisations, youth, UN agencies, and donors, to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment.

The Gender-Responsive Governance programme at UN Women Bangladesh, aligned with Outcome 3 and Outcome 4 of the UN Women Bangladesh Strategic Note (2022-2026) and Strategic Priority 4 and 5 of the UNSDCF 2022-2025, aims contribute to an environment where more people, especially the most vulnerable, benefit from more equitable, non-discriminatory, gender-responsive, participatory, accountable governance and justice, in a peaceful and tolerant society governed by the rule of law, and where women, girls and gender-diverse people are empowered to exercise their rights, agency and decision-making power over all aspects of their lives and are free from all forms of discrimination, violence and harmful norms and practices. In pursuit of this, the Gender-Responsive Governance Unit implements initiatives to advance the implementation of normative frameworks; gender-responsive planning and budgeting; gender statistics; women, peace, and security; and women’s participation, representation, and leadership.

UN Women works closely with the Government of Bangladesh, most notably with the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) to uphold and implement its normative commitments to international treaty bodies, such as the Beijing Platform of Action (BPfA), Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and its Concluding Observations, Commission of the Status of Women agreed conclusions, UN Security Council Resolution 1325, and gender equality related commitments of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This also includes strengthening gender-responsive planning and budgeting to enable gender mainstreaming across all sectoral ministries and departments. In coordination with the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the Gender-Responsive Governance programme implements the global flagship programme initiative ‘Making Every Women and Girl Count’ to support the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs by strengthening how gender statistics are collected, analyzed, and used. The programme maintains a strong focus on supporting women’s participation, representation, and leadership in line with international commitments such as CEDAW, which upholds women’s right to participate in public life, and the (BPfA) which calls for removing barriers to equal participation. In line with the Leaving No One Behind (LNOB) principles, the programme partners with civil society to ensure that the voices of the most vulnerable women and grassroots women are included in decision-making, with an emphasis on inter-generational feminist leadership.

Reporting to the Deputy Representative, the Programme Analyst contributes to the effective management of UN Women programmes in Bangladesh by providing substantive inputs to programme design, formulation, implementation and evaluation. The Programme Analyst guides and facilitates the delivery of UN Women programmes by monitoring results achieved during implementation and ensuring appropriate application of systems and procedures and develops enhancements if necessary. The Programme Analyst works in close collaboration with the programme and operations team in Dhaka and Cox’s Bazar, UN Women HQ and Regional personnel, Government officials, multi and bi-lateral donors and civil society ensuring successful UN Women programme implementation under portfolio.

Job Summary

CARE is one of the world's leading international humanitarian and development organizations, committed to helping people in poor communities improve their lives and alleviate poverty. Founded in 1945, CARE is working over 100 countries to fight global poverty and marginalization. CARE has been active in Bangladesh since 1949 and is one of the largest programs in CARE confederation. Women and girls are at the core of all CARE programs because they represent half of the marginalized group and it is not possible to overcome poverty until all people have equal rights and opportunities. CARE Bangladesh works to implement programs with long-term impacts that result in sustainable changes for the extreme poor and marginalized communities.

Bangladesh has made impressive strides in its social and economic development, achieving lower middle-income status in 2015 through stable macroeconomic conditions and substantial poverty reduction. The nation adeptly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining positive real GDP growth through prudent macroeconomic policies and effective stimulus measures. However, challenges persist, particularly for its youth population. With an overall unemployment rate of 8.9% among those aged 15-29, around 27% of this group is labeled as NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). Notably, this NEET issue is predominantly a gender concern as approximately 90% of NEET youth are female. Social norms emphasizing women's household roles and movement restrictions contribute to these disparities which is evident in the significantly lower female labor force participation.

The EARN Project in Bangladesh aims at economic engagement of the NEET youth, especially women, in rural and semi-urban areas of the country. The project offers education and skills development with a focus on women-centric facilities, employment and enterprise development support, enhanced employability through creating employer linkages and upskilling of Socio-Emotional Behavior (SEB) and Entrepreneur Development (ED) skill, incubation support for employment and entrepreneurship. In order to ensure participation of women and other underserved segment, the project will promote an enabling environment, especially for the women, through targeted awareness raising and communication programs, family-based planning, counseling and involving the communities and families in planning and monitoring of implementation.

In the case of Bangladesh, a country particularly vulnerable to climate change, there are several potential benefits, and specific conditions, including youth-centric ones, that can enhance climate co-benefit advantages. The project is designed for addressing climate change impacts and disasters. Bangladesh, in general, is increasingly being exposed to climate change-related hazards. The location of the project would be spread over many sub-districts, including extreme precipitation and flooding. Education and training programs have been severely affected by flooding in particular. The potential risks to education/climate resilient training facilities covered by the project due to flooding would be significantly reduced by the design of these facilities and the inclusion of soft components (e.g., training and awareness programs), which take flood risk into account.

The project will undertake climate resilience programs and enhance institutional capacity to improve the understanding of the responsiveness to disruptions from climate change and geophysical hazards. All skills development training will incorporate climate sensitization courses that will include adaptation and mitigation measures. The proposed competitive innovation funds will also be used to customize the new climate responsive awareness among the beneficiaries.

The Management Information System Expert has a key role in projects, overseeing systematic information and data management systems for projects, programs, and organizational performance. He/she will update and maintain project information for the organizational dashboard and coordinate data across CARE Bangladesh. Additionally, he/she will provide guidance to projects/programs colleagues for improved information-sharing practices within the project.

 Perform data quality checks to ensure data integrity and reliability, and track assessments, reviews and evaluations, including through data collection, data entry and data analysis.

CARE expects all staff and volunteers to share this commitment through our Code of Conduct.

In this capacity, we work to restore safety, dignity and hope to millions who are uprooted, struggling to endure and wishing to advance on a path of development.

The IRC has been present in Bangladesh since 2017 and obtained registration with the NGOAB in March 2018. Since the IRC obtained registration in March 2018, it has moved quickly to expand its integrated emergency health and protection response through both direct and partner-based programming focused on primary healthcare, women’s protection and empowerment, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence and child protection. Through 2018, the IRC’s response strategy will primarily target Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, while meeting the significant needs in both refugee and host populations, as already existing vulnerabilities are compounded with cyclical monsoon and cyclone seasons that impose additional threats to the lives and protection of those refugees as well as vulnerable host populations. IRC Bangladesh’s strategic vision is to protect, empower and meet the needs of the most vulnerable women, children and youth through technical expertise and partnerships in the areas of integrated protection, health, education and economic wellbeing before, during, and after displacement caused by conflict and climate-induced disaster. IRC will grow over time its geographic coverage within Cox bazar and to other parts of the country, thus expand its’ networks and partnerships around emergency preparedness and response work, reach beyond the Rohingya refugees, also targeting the vulnerable host communities in Cox Bazar and Southern parts of Bangladesh.

Working with Consensys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

You will have the opportunity to work with and learn from some of the brightest minds in the space, to see how we approach hacking, threat modelling, scanning, auditing, designing and enhancing the security of smart contracts across the board.

Alongside client work, we also provide you with plenty of time for research and development efforts where you can push the state of the art and science of blockchain security.

Most of the work can be done remotely from wherever you are; little travel is anticipated (most of the team works remotely around the world). Along with a focus on technical excellence, we also believe firmly that culture and processes play an essential role in security.
